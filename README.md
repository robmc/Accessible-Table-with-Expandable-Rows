# Accessible-Table-with-Expandable-Rows

This is a placeholder for testing. This structure is a basic table with 1 cell per row to expand the row and show additional information. If implementing a structure such as this, only one cell per row must be the actionable cell as it may be confusing or cumbersome for users who rely on the keyboard and/or assistive technologies if every cell can expand the row(s). This is used for testing with different markup but is not currently accessible in its entirety. The table column with the control to expand the rows provides an off-screen label for users of screen readers to have context when navigating using table navigation commands and the controls leverage the [aria-expanded](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-expanded) state to convey their state.

Notes:
When interacting with a table with expandable rows (Ex: Transaction history that shows expenditures with dates, businesses, amounts, etc.), the content within the expandable rows are generally not related to the table structure. For example, if activating the cell to display additional information such as business hours or location, this information is not related to the table. The [aria-level](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-level) role can be used with [role="grid"](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#grid) however it can be argued that the additional information is not related to the grid/table information if it is supplemental. For this reason, a labelled [region](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#region) can be used or it can be treated as a non-modal [dialog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#dialog) that is properly labeled.
